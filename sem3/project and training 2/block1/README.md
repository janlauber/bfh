## Exercise 10: Universal Hashing
The class Object in Java contains a method called hashCode() which yields for each object a hash value.

**Your Tasks**:  
a) How this method is realized for the objects of type java.lang.String? Describe an efficient way to compute this hash value efficiently?  
b) What is universal hashing? Describe the main idea of universal hashing. Describe two different function sets realizing universal hashing.  
c) Implement a hash method for the class java.lang.String based on the universal functions described above.  
d) Compute the runtime complexity of your method hashCode() and compare it iwth the Java implementation from above.
